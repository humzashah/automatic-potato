# Automatic Potato!!! :sweet_potato:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/humzashah/automatic-potato.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/humzashah/automatic-potato)

Automatically fetch a random potato by going to [http://localhost:3000/auto-potate](http://localhost:3000/auto-potate).

## Introduction

I originally planned to have some fun with this project (see __Origin__ section below). Later, I decided to used this simple structure as a small experiment to compare different frameworks.

Each framework has its own folder in the `frameworks` directory, with each folder having its own `README.md` that includes setup details.

**Notes**

* An attempt has been made to serve each image non-statically so it goes through the framework's own file-processing/serving mechanism.

* Actual package dependency files/folders e.g. `Gemfile.lock` and `node_modules` have been excluded from the project to keep the respository's size small. Exact versions of these packages have of course been specified wherever possible, like in the `Gemfile` or `package.json` files.

### Example Output in Browser for Each Framework

## Origin

**Kristopher Johnson** made [an excellent suggestion](https://twitter.com/OldManKris/status/673184195485790208) which this project is a result of. Here is a screenshot in case the link to that tweet no longer works:

GitHub suggested the following repository name:

The rest is history.
